      * is a
      * bulleted
      * list

  Numbered list:

      1. this
      2. is a
      3. numbered
      4. list

  ## Paragraphs

  You separate paragraphs with an empty new line:

      This is one paragraph.

      This is another paragraph.

  To make a line break (without making a new paragraph), use `<br>`:

      This is one line<br>
      Which I wanted to break.
